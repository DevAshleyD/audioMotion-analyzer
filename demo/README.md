# audioMotion-analyzer demos

The demo scripts use [ES6 native modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules#Applying_the_module_to_your_HTML).

Due to JavaScript security requirements, modules must be loaded via HTTP protocol.
If you want to play with the demo files locally, you'll need a local web server, such as [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server).

If you have npm installed, just run `npm start` in the project's folder and open http://localhost:8080/demo in your browser to load the demos.
